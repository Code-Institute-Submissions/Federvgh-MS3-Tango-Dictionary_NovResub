 Tango is a style of music widely know accross the world, its rythm, its swing, but one of the most 
 interesting things it has is the language or "Slang" used in its lyrics. The purpose of this website 
 is to allow english speakers to get  an idea of what some words that they might have heard of in a song and dont 
 know what they mean because they wont appear on traditional spanish dictionary mean. </p>
